## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NobleOsinachi/innercitymission-next-js/
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:** Move into the project directory using the following command:

   ```bash
   cd innercitymission-next-js
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:** Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server:** Start the Next.js development server using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will launch the development server and make the project accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Explore and learn:** Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the InnerCityMission homepage clone. You can now explore the project's code, modify components, and experiment with different architectural patterns to enhance your understanding of Next.js and component-based development.
